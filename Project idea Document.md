Introduction: 
Poem by unknown:
[Trees can be short, trees can be tall
Whatever kind, I like them all
They give us oxygen, they give us air
We give them love, we give them care. 
We take care of each, as if they were our own, 
From when theyŕe seedling, to fully grown. 
From berries to cherries, from apples to grapes
They gives us different fruits, and grow in different shapes. 
With their colorful leaves and long, brown trunk
We know that the beautiful trees are not junk. 
They need water, soil, space and light, 
We give them those things day and night.]

Imagine this, you walk around and you have a great idea! Well, great! But you do not have the resources or expertise to grow this idea to its full potential. We have the solution for you: The Idea Tree. The idea tree is a web application which offers a ground for you to plant your seed and let others water and nurture it and grow it into a beautiful project. Just like an actual tree, you will be able to implement, kill, branch, grow and truncate your ideas. Think about it as a Github for ideas. 


Relevance to the Course: 
This project will see different challenges relating to the Information Retrieval course. First of all, different rankings will be needed to identify the right projects for the user to contribute to, expert tags. Linkage between different people will be based on interests, the question of course is how we should do this. 

<b>How the idea is placed with respect to the state of the art</b>
Different because it only focuses on ideas. No direct help like standard Q&A. Important is to enable an idea to grow. Finding out how it grows. How to enable a crowd for an idea.

- Way to discriminate between ideas (other move up)
- People should linking people
- Ranking of ideas
- Link to kickstarter
- Visuals
- Search Algorithm 
- Request and fill request
- you should do anything with the ideas that are implemented // get .. stuff //
