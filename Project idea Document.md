<H2>Pitch/Introduction</H2>
Imagine this, you walk around and you have a great idea! Well, great! But you do not have the resources or expertise to grow this idea to its full potential. We have the solution for you: The Idea Tree. The idea tree is a web application which offers a ground for you to plant your seed and let others water and nurture it and grow it into a beautiful project. Just like an actual tree, you will be able to implement, kill, branch, grow and truncate your ideas. Think about it as a Github for ideas. 

Different because it only focuses on ideas. No direct help like standard Q&A. Important is to enable an idea to grow. Finding out how it grows. How to enable a crowd for an idea. 

<H2>Information Retrieval</H2>
This project will see different challenges relating to the Information Retrieval course. First of all, different rankings will be needed to identify the right projects for the user to contribute to, expert tags. Linkage between different people will be based on interests, the question of course is how we should do this. 

<H2>Motivating the Crowd and Monetization</H2>
The possibility to sell the ideas to companies was mentioned. I prefer the idea of being more involved in the execution of the idea. With the site open to use and view by anyone nothing is stopping companies from getting the ideas for free. With something as intangible as an idea it is near impossible to claim rights on it. I think the best way to monetize and have the site be sustainable is to find people skilled to implement the idea and start a kickstarter to collect funds. Fact is that a lot of kickstarter projects don't reach their target. When starting a kickstarter campaign for a idea from our platform however we already have contributors and people invested in the idea who might be interested to donate and spread the word about the project. People that have contributed ideas to the project can then eventually receive a percentage of the revenue created when the product is on the market (for mobile apps at least its easy to get something in an app store).

Also, the idea of ads was shot down by the professor, but I believe that if you can show ads that are relevant and non-intrusive it is not a bad idea. For example, there is an popular idea to make a virtual pet dragon app. You can have a web-crawler search for a similar app that is already available (similar but most likely not exactly the same) and offer the makers of the app some adspace on the site. The ad would be relevant to what the user is looking at. The idea on the site can still be elaborated on and might turn into something quite different.

<H2>Requirements and Specifications</H2>
Scope reduced to mobile apps for project but possible to expand. Input limited to image + text. User can check the status of his idea or send it to friends so that they can vote. As someone votes, they immediately see the next idea, hopefully keeping them engaged to vote on more ideas. Platform language = English (possible to expand in future).

User Profile should include: Ideas submitted (with status(number of votes, percentage)). Ideas they liked. Hidden: the ideas they voted down, so they don't have the same ideas popping up.

<H2>UML Design</H2>
KISS - Design principle (Keep it simple, Stupid!). Each step in the process should be as easy as possible for the user.

Phase 1:
<ul>
<li>Step 1 – Submit Idea. </li>
<li>Step 2 – Vetting Process. Crowdflower. Check for appropriateness. No spam & dick pics.</li>
<li>Step 3 – Voting Process. Like (+1), Not Like (+0), Share (Facebook, etc). Tinder-like. Swipe left. Swipe right.</li>
<li>Step 4 – Clustering Ideas. Search engine</li>
<li>Step 5 – Ranking Ideas.</li>
<li>Step 6 – Presenting Best results.</li>
</ul>
Phase 2:
Ideas will be elaborated upon. This would be a type of collaboration platform where people can comment and edit. I don't think we'll actually implement this phase. We should make some mock-ups to show the process.

<H2>Evaluation and Success Metrics</H2>

<H2>Execution Plan</H2>
Project execution plan (PEP) is a document that is prepared at the start of a project, in order to provide details about the project itself, its team members, their responsibilities and interconnection or integration of administrative and management procedures.

----------------------------------------------------------------

// purpose: written form of your pitch presentation. In details, you are required to formalise the project topic and to motivate in a written form: 
<b>== Pitch ==:
	- why the idea is exciting
	- How the idea is relevant to the course
	- How the idea is placed with respect to the state of the art
.. sketch the major components of the project
	- Give a rough timeline. When do you plan to complete these components? 
	- Explain who in your team will be responsible for which components. 
.. How can you evaluate whether you succeeded? </b>

Mock-ups and prototype demonstrations are welcome. 

<b>== Project idea document == 
	- The relevance to the course
	- The innovative and challenging nature of the project
	- The requirements/specifications of the application to develop;
	- A coarse-grained execution plan; 
	- a first UML design of your application; 
	- your planned evaluation and success metrics</b>

Introduction: 
Poem by unknown:
[Trees can be short, trees can be tall
Whatever kind, I like them all
They give us oxygen, they give us air
We give them love, we give them care. 
We take care of each, as if they were our own, 
From when theyŕe seedling, to fully grown. 
From berries to cherries, from apples to grapes
They gives us different fruits, and grow in different shapes. 
With their colorful leaves and long, brown trunk
We know that the beautiful trees are not junk. 
They need water, soil, space and light, 
We give them those things day and night.]

What should it do? [pure from notes]
- Plan your idea at the seed and let people water and nurture and grow it into a beautiful project.
- Set up requirements etc. v2
- Enable users to ask for ideas depending on their interests or requirements
- Profiles with interests
- Tag main themes / interests
- Searches for people that have these tags
- Login functions
- Show top risers/ recently added / …/
- Filter for relevance
- Way to discriminate between ideas (other move up)
- People should linking people
- Ranking of ideas
- Link to kickstarter
- Visuals
- Search Algorithm 
- Request and fill request
- you should do anything with the ideas that are implemented // get .. stuff //
