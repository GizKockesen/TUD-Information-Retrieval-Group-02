## Notes from 18/2 meeting with Prof Bozzon

### Improved Project Idea
* Application that crowdsources invention ideas
* first phase
  * users can submit ideas, a picture and short text block
  * other users upvote or downvote ideas in a "tinder-like" application 
  * This can be worked in a different type of application, use as "in between screen" which people see between pages
* ideas move to second phase after enough upvotes (to be determined)
  * (?)The top ideas can be worked out by a team of developers, which then will be pitched to companies for sale. 
* second phase
  * ideas are annotated with longer description
  * users can comment and elaborate on ideas

###Meeting Requirements
* **Croudsourcing:** from crowd submitting ideas
* **Human Computing:** humans needs to do "appropriateness check" on picturs submitted in first phase
* **Information Retrieval:** grouping and searching the idea pool. Plus we can show which ideas are trending. 
* **Who is the client?:** companies willing to buy ideas from the second phase.
